**What I would do differently next time:**
This was one of my first projects in JS, so there's plenty.
1. Remove 'var' completely and replace with const, let.
2. Use encapsulation. I created variables with global scope. 
3. Some functions do too much. I'd split them, create a few helper functions and abstract them away.
4. It's tough to read this code, not knowing what belongs where. I would create prototypes and would group functionality.
